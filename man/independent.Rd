\title{Add independent error to data}
\usage{
independent(
  data,
  mean = c(0, 0),
  covariance = matrix(c(0.031^2, 0, 0, 0.027^2), nrow = 2, ncol = 2)
)
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{A data.frame containing the data on which to base the parameters
of the constant velocity model. This function assumes that this data.frame
contains the columns \code{"time"}, \code{"x"}, and \code{"y"} containing 
the time at which the observed position (x, y) was measured respectively.}

\item{mean}{Numeric vector with 1 or 2 values containing the mean of the 
error process. If only 1 number is provided, then this value will be assumed
to represent the mean for both the x- and y-dimensions. Defaults to 
\code{c(0, 0)}, representing no bias in the system.}

\item{covariance}{Numeric matrix of dimensionality \eqn{2 \times 2}, 
having the variances of the errors for x and y on the diagonal and the 
covariance of the errors on the off-diagonal. Defaults to having the variances
of the x- and y-dimension being equal to \code{0.031^2} and \code{0.027^2}
respectively, and the covariance being equal to \code{0.02}. These values 
represent the means of the respective variances and covariances found 
across the four days of the calibration study that informed this project.}
}
\value{
A \code{data.frame} in which the \code{"x"} and \code{"y"} columns 
have additional noise in them.
}
\description{
Error is generated through a multivariate normal distribution with a
\code{mean} and \code{covariance} that are specified by the user. Primary 
assumption of this model is that the errors are independent over time, 
which stands in contrast to the \code{\link[denoiser]{temporal()}} model.
}
\details{
According to this function, the observed positions \eqn{\mathbf{y}_i} at time
\eqn{t_i} contain some white noise error. In symbols, this comes down to 
saying that:

\deqn{\mathbf{\epsilon}_{i} \sim N(\mathbf{\mu}, \Sigma)}
where \eqn{\mathbf{\mu}} represents the mean of the noise and \eqn{\Sigma}
the covariance matrix of the noise. The observed positions \eqn{\mathbf{y}_i}
then consist of a systematic component (i.e., the latent positions, provided
in \code{data}) and an unsystematic error component so that:

\deqn{\mathbf{y}_i = \mathbf{x}_i + \mathbf{\epsilon}_i}
}
\examples{
# Generate data for illustration purposes. Movement in circular motion at a
# pace of 1.27m/s with some added noise of SD = 10cm.
angles <- seq(0, 4 * pi, length.out = 100)
coordinates <- 10 * cbind(cos(angles), sin(angles))

data <- data.frame(
  x = coordinates[, 1],
  y = coordinates[, 2],
  time = 1:100
)

# Add independent noise to these data with an error variance of 0.01 in each
# dimension

  mean = c(0, 0),
