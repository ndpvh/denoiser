# denoiser

## Overview

This package contains functions for adding noise to and filtering out
noise from positional data, that is data that contains measurements of
x- and y-coordinates. This package implements code that allows for the
addition of realistic noise to simulated data and for the user to employ
a realistic filtering pipeline to simulated and empirical data,
therefore allowing for realistic recovery studies for pedestrian
modelers. Answers this specific need for the [Minds for Mobile
Agents](https://www.ampl-psych.com/projects/minds-for-mobile-agents/)
pedestrian model implemented in the [predped
package](https://github.com/ndpvh/predped), but can be more broadly
applied.

The implementation of this package and the defaults provided to the
arguments of its functions is heavily based on results of a study
conducted by Dr. Niels Vanhasbroeck and Prof. Dr. Andrew Heathcote, the
repository of which you can find
[here](https://github.com/ndpvh/calibration-movement-data).

## Getting started

### Installation

You can install the package from Github through the command:

    remotes::install_github("ndpvh/denoiser")

Once installed, you can load the package through the `library` function.

    library(denoiser)

### Usage

The primary functionality of this package is provided through two
functions, namely `noiser` and `denoiser`. Imagine having data that
contains circular movement, such as in the following case:

    # Create x- and y-coordinates for a person walking in a full circle
    angles <- seq(0, 2 * pi, length.out = 50)
    data <- data.frame(
        time = 1:50,
        x = 10 * cos(angles),
        y = 10 * sin(angles)
    )

Then one can add “realistic” noise to these data by using the `noiser`
function. Specifically, you call:

    # Noise up the data
    noised_up <- noiser(
        data,
        # Arguments defining the noising
    )

To decrease the noise again, we call the `denoiser` function:

    # Denoise the data
    denoised <- denoiser(
        noised_up,
        # Arguments defining the denoising
    )

For more details on how to use these functions, I refer the reader to
the [Documentation](https://ndpvh.github.io/denoiser).

## Getting help

You can find detailed documentation of the functions in this package as
well as examples on the [Documentation
site](https://ndpvh.github.io/denoiser). If you encounter a bug, please
file an issue with a minimal working example on
[Github](https://github.com/ndpvh/denoiser/issues).
